# Backend Design Overview

This document provides an overview of the design and architecture of the backend system for the project.

## Components and Responsibilities

### Server (`server.js`)

- Initializes the Express server.
- Defines middleware for request handling.
- Routes requests to appropriate controllers based on URL paths.
- Manages HTTP responses and error handling.

### Controllers (`controllers/`)

- Define RESTful endpoints.
- Validate request data using middleware like `express-validator`.
- Call corresponding service functions for business logic.

- **Example**: `userController.js`
  - Handles endpoints related to user management.
  - Validates incoming data for user registration.
  - Calls functions from `userService.js` for business logic.

### Services (`services/`)

- Implement business logic.
- Interact with models to perform CRUD operations.
- Handle authentication, validation, and other application-specific logic.

- **Example**: `userService.js`
  - Implements functions for user registration, profile retrieval, etc.
  - Interacts with `userModel.js` to perform database operations.

### Models (`models/`)

- Define data structures (schemas) used by the application.
- Execute SQL queries to interact with the database.
- Return structured data to services for further processing.

- **Example**: `userModel.js`
  - Defines the schema and methods related to the `users` table.
  - Executes SQL queries or interacts with an ORM to perform database operations.

### Database (`config/db.js`)

- Establishes and manages database connections.
- Provides methods to execute queries safely using parameterized queries or ORM.
- Ensures efficient handling of database connections and transactions.

## Summary

This backend architecture follows a structured MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern where controllers manage incoming requests, services handle business logic and data manipulation, and models interact with the database. This separation of concerns ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the application.

Understanding these components and their responsibilities will help in developing, maintaining, and debugging the backend system effectively.
